> The main difference between reviews and testimonials is that reviews are displayed on third-party platforms, while testimonials are displayed by platforms owned by the business.
Both reviews and testimonials give us details about customersâ€™ experience with a brand or company. However, they are not the same. Testimonials are likely to be positive since they are gathered directly by the company from customers who are happy and satisfied with the service. Reviews, on the other hand, can be good or bad, and the company has no direct involvement in them.
